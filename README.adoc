# Backup

This is a description and architecture of backup solution, which will cover my personal needs.

## Functional requirements ##

* There are few data types, which I need to backup. They can be discribed as:
** Big, changes infrequently, important, long-lived. Like: personal images and videos. 
** Small, changes regulary, important, long-lived. Like: documents, ids, scans, bills.
** Small, not important, but sad to lose. Like: books, manuals.
** Small, recoverable from other sources, need to be able to restore quickly. All related to work: source code, settings, portable apps, env configs.
* It should be possible to backup to:
** Local storage. Like: external hard drive connected via USB to computer.
** Remote storage. Like NAS server somethere out in the NET: local or Internet.
** S3
* The backup should be incremental.
* Backup to S3 should be cost effective. I want to backup to S3 only really important data. I will read data from S3 only to recover.
* Need to support linux/win clients.
* Data should be replicated across storages.

## Roadmap ##

* [*done*] Mount external HDD to RaspberryPI via powered USB hub.
* Setup cygwin + rsync in Win client. Verify cygwin+rsync => PI is working.
* Simple Java client.
